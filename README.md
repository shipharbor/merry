Merry is a little Node framework that helps you build performant applications
with little effort. We don't think that "fast" and "cute" should be mutually
exclusive. Out of the box we've included standardized logging, consistent error
handling, a clean streams API and plenty of nuts, bolts and options to
customize merry to fit your use case. We hope you have a good time using it.
:v: _-Team Merry_

## Features
- __fast:__ using Node streams, merry handles request like no other
- __fun:__ helps with boring stuff like error handling
- __communicative:__ standardized [ndjson][ndjson] logs for everything
- __sincere:__ doesn't monkey patch Node's built-ins
- __linear:__ smooth sailing from tinkering to production
- __very cute:__ üåäüåä‚õµÔ∏èüåäüåä

## Usage
Given the following `index.js`:
```js
var merry = require('merry')
var pump = require('pump')
var http = require('http')

var notFound = merry.notFound
var error = merry.error

var env = merry.env({ PORT: 8080 })
var app = merry()

app.router([
  [ '/', homePath ],
  [ '/error', errorPath ],
  [ '/api', {
    put: apiPutPath,
    get: apiGetPath
  } ],
  [ '/404', notFound() ]
])

var server = http.createServer(app.start())
server.listen(env.PORT)

function homePath (req, res, ctx, done) {
  done(null, 'hello world')
}

function errorPath (req, res, ctx, done) {
  done(null, 'hello world')
}

function apiGetPath (req, res, ctx, done) {
  done(null, 'hello HTTP GET')
}

function apiPutPath (req, res, ctx, done) {
  done(null, 'hello HTTP PUT')
}
```

The application will now start printing log messages to stdout. `merry` ships
with a CLI tool called `merry` that formats the messages for humans:
```sh
$ node index.js | merry
```

## Logging
Merry uses the `pino` logger under the hood. When you create a new `merry` app,
we enable a log forwarder that by default prints all logs to `process.stdout`:
```js
var merry = require('merry')
var app = merry()

app.log.info('look at the logs!')
```

There are different log levels that can be used. The possible log levels are:
- __debug:__ used for developer annotation only, should not be enable in
  production
- __info:__ used for transactional messages
- __warn:__ used for expected errors
- __error:__ used for unexpected errors
- __fatal:__ used for critical errors that should terminate the process

```js
var merry = require('merry')
var app = merry()

app.log.debug('it works!')
app.log.info('hey')
app.log.warn('oh')
app.log.error('oh no!')
app.log.fatal('send help')
```

The difference between an expected and unexpected error is that the first is
generally caused by a user (e.g. wrong password) and the system knows how to
respond, and the latter is caused by the system (e.g. there's no database) and
the system doesn't know how to handle it.

## Error handling
The `done(err, stream)` callback can either take an error or a readable stream. If an
error has `.statusCode` property, that value will be used for `res.statusCode`.
Else it'll use any status code that was set previously, and default to `500`.

:warning: the error will be logged as loglevel `'warn'`. It's important to
not disclose any internal information in `4xx` type errors, as it can lead to
serious security vulnerabilities. All errors in other ranges (typically `5xx`)
will send back the message `'server error'` and are logged as loglevel
`'error'`.

## Configuration
Generally there are two ways of passing configuration into an application.
Through files and through command line arguments. In practice it turns out
passing environment variables can be done with less friction than using files.
Especially in siloed environments such as Docker and Kubernetes where mounting
volumes can at times be tricky, but passing environment variables is trivial.

Merry ships with an environment argument validator that checks the type of
argument passed in, and optionally falls back to a default if no value is
passed in. To set the (very common) `$PORT` variable to default to `8080` do:
```js
var merry = require('merry')
var env = merry.env({ PORT: 8080 })
console.log('port: ' + env.PORT)
```

And then from the CLI do:
```sh
node ./server.js
// => port: 8080

PORT=1234 node ./server.js
// => port: 1234
```

## Routing
Merry uses `server-router` under the hood to create its routes. Routes are
created using recursive arrays that are turned into an efficient `trie`
structure under the hood. You don't need to worry about any of this though; all
you need to know is that we've tested it and it's probably among the fastest
methods out there. Routes look like this:
```js
var merry = require('merry')
var app = merry()
app.router([
  ['/', handleIndex],
  ['/foo', handleFoo, [
    ['/:bar', handleFoobarPartial]
  ]]
])
```

Partial routes can be set using the `':'` delimiter. Any route that's
registered in this was will be passed to the `ctx` argument as a key. So
given a route of `/foo/:bar` and we call it with `/foo/hello`, it will show up
in `ctx` as `{ bar: 'hello' }`.

## Encoders
If `Object` and `Array` are the data primitives of JavaScript, JSON is the
primitive of APIs. By passing JSON to the `done(null, json)` Merry sets the right
headers on `res` and converts it to a readable stream for the router to work.
```js
var merry = require('merry')
var http = require('http')

var app = merry()
app.router(['/', function (req, res, ctx, done) {
  done(null, { message: 'hello JSON' })
}])

var server = http.createServer(app.start())
server.listen(8080)
```


## Parsers
To make it easy to operate on common data types, we've included body parsers.
These functions take the `req` readable stream, concatenate it and return the resulting
data, or an error if it didn't succeed.

### Strings
```js
var merry = require('merry')
var app = merry()
app.router([
  ['/string', {
    put: function (req, res, ctx, done) {
      merry.parse.string(req, function (err, string) {
        if (err) return done(err)
        ctx.string = string
        done(null, 'done parsing string')
      })
    }
  }]
])
```

### JSON
```js
var merry = require('merry')
var app = merry()
app.router([
  ['/json', {
    put: function (req, res, ctx, done) {
      merry.parse.json(req, function (err, json) {
        if (err) return done(err)
        ctx.json = json
        done(null, 'done parsing json')
      })
    }
  }]
])
```

### JSON Schema
One of the most common things for your code to consume is probably going to be
JSON. The problem is that it doesn't always come back in the nice format you
might need. But we gotchu: the `middleware` portion of Merry validates that
for you. `middleware.schema` takes in a JSON schema and validates the request
body against it.

```js
var merry = require('merry')

var mw = merry.middleware
var mySchema = `
  {
    "required": true,
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "hello": {
        "required": true,
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
  }
`

var app = merry()
app.router([
  ['/foo', mw([mw.schema(mySchema), myCoolEndpoint])]
])

function myCoolEndpoint (req, res, ctx, done) {
  console.log('hot code bod', ctx.body)
  done(null, 'success!')
}
```

## Middleware
Middleware is a way to handle access to `req` and `res` objects across multiple
functions when working with req-res cycle of an application. With merry, you can
set up a middleware set of functions to handle a request. Only the last handler
will propogate data, all others handle errors.

```js
var merry = require('merry')

var mw = merry.middleware
var app = merry()
app.router([
  ['/foo', mw([otherHandler, myCoolEndpoint])]
])

function otherHandler (req, res, ctx, done) {
  ctx.foo = 'bar'
  done()
}

function myCoolEndpoint (req, res, ctx, done) {
  console.log('woah look at me, shiny code', ctx.foo)
  done(null, 'its so shiny')
}
```

### Middleware Gateway
An alternate way of consuming middleware is through `merry.gateway`. This
creates an object on which you can set values, which might result in something
slightly more readable when consuming lots of middleware.

```js
var merry = require('merry')

var gate = merry.gateway()
var app = merry()
app.router([
  ['/foo', {
    get: gate({
      schema: fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'schemas/my-cool-schema')),
      handler: require('./handlers/my-cool-handler')
    })
  }]
]).listen(8080)
```

If you want to pass custom middleware, the gateway constructor can take an
array of middleware. By default this is applied _after_ the built-in
middleware. You can change the order of arguments by passing the order
argument.

```js
var gate = merry.gateway({
  middleware: [ require('my-mw'), require('other-mw') ]
})
```

## Plugins
Plugins provide a way to access framework internals in a clean way. You can
register plugins through `app.use()`.

```js
var app = merry()
app.use({
  onRequest: function (req, res, done) {
    res.statusCode = 401   // all statusCodes will now default to 401
    done()
  }
})
```

## API
### app = merry(opts)
Create a new instance of `merry`. Takes optional opts:
- __opts.logLevel:__ defaults to `'info'`. Determine the cutoff point for
  logging
- __opts.logStream:__ defaults to `process.stdout`. Set the output writable stream to
  write logs to

### app.router(opts?, [routes])
Register routes on the router. Take the following opts:
- __default:__ (default: `'/404'`) Default route handler if no route matches

#### routes
Each route has a signature of `(req, res, ctx, done)`:
- __req:__ the server's unmodified `req` object
- __res:__ the server's unmodified `res` object
- __ctx:__ an object that can contain values and methods. Includes `.params`
  which are the parameters picked up from the `router` using the `:route`
  syntax in the route
- __done:__ a handler with a signature of `(err, stream)`, that takes either an
  error or a readable stream. If a stream is passed it pipes the readable
  stream to `res` until it is done.

### handler = app.start()
Create a handler that can be passed directly into an `http` server.
```js
var merry = require('merry')
var http = require('http')

var app = merry()
app.router(['/', handleRoute])

var handler = app.start()
var server = http.createServer(handler)
server.listen(8080)

function handleRoute (req, res, ctx, done) {
  done(null, 'hello planet')
}
```

### app.listen()
Start the application directly
```js
var merry = require('merry')

var app = merry()
app.router(['/', handleRoute])
app.listen(8080)

function handleRoute (req, res, ctx, done) {
  done(null, 'hello planet')
}
```

### app.use(plugin)
Register a plugin on the merry instance. A plugin is an object where the
following values are possible:
- __onRequest(req, res, done):__ called before a request is passed into the
  router. `done()` can be called when the handler is done, and ready to pass
  control to the next handler (or router if there are no handlers left). If the
  request is terminated inside the handler, `done()` should not be called.

### error = merry.error(obj)
Create a new HTTP error from an object. Expects a `.statusCode` and a `.message`
property. Optionally it can also take a `.data` property to send extra data to
the client. The entire error is logg when passed into `send(error)`, but only
`statusCode`, `message` and `data` are sent to the client.

### error = merry.wrap(err, [obj])
Convert an `Error` object into an HTTP error. Optionally takes a second
argument which can contain the properties `.statusCode` and `.message`. Use
this method to turn internal errors (e.g. the database returned an error) into
messages that you can send back to the client without leaking extra data.

### app.log.method(log)
Send a log to the log output stream. See the [logging section](#logging) for
more details.

### env = merry.env(settings)
Create a new configuration client that reads environment variables from
`process.env` and validates them against configuration.

### notFound = merry.notFound()
Create a naive `/404` handler that can be passed into a path.

### routeHandler = merry.cors(handler)
Add CORS support for handlers. Adds an handler for the HTTP `OPTIONS` method to
catch preflight requests.

### routeHandler = merry.middleware(handlers)
Takes an array of handler functions. Each handler has a signature of
`handler(req, res, ctx, done)`. `ctx` is an object onto which data can be
attached. The `ctx` object is shared from one handler onto the other. If an
error occurs, it can be passed into `done(err)`. When a middleware handler is
done executing, it should call `done()`.

The last handler in the array of handlers is expected to send back a response:
the `done()` function has a signature of
`done(err|null, null|readableStream|string|object)`.

### middleware.schema(string)
Takes a JSON string to validate the response against. It will parse and validate
the `res` against the schema, and attach it to `ctx.body` as part of middleware.

### merry.parse.json(req, handler(err, object))
Parse JSON in request body. Returns an object.

### merry.parse.multipart(req|headers, [options], filehandler)
Parse a multipart upload (e.g. uploading files to the server). Filehandler has
an API of `filehandler(fieldname, file, filename, encoding, mimetype)`. Uses
[multipart-read-stream](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/multipart-read-stream)
under the hood. Note that this does not validate, scan or fingerprint any
content.

### merry.parse.text(req, handler(err, text))
Parse text in request body. Returns a string. You can alternativel use an alias
of `merry.parse.string`.

### gateway = merry.gateway(opts)
Create a new gateway opts. By default includes all middleware exposed by
`merry.middleware`. Takes the following opts:
- __opts.middleware:__ Pass in an object containing additional middleware.
- __opts.order:__ Specify the order in which the middleware must be applied.
  Should be an array of strings. Defaults to whatever `Object.keys` returns.

### routeHandler = gateway(opts)
Create new routeHandler from a `gateway` instance. `opts` is configuration for
the middleware that's used.
